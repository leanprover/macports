description         Lean Theorem Prover
long_description    Lean is a new open source theorem prover being developed at Microsoft Research, \
                    and its standard library at Carnegie Mellon University. The Lean Theorem Prover \
                    aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by \
                    situating automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction \
                    and the construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. The goal is to support \
                    both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex systems, and to verify \
                    claims in both domains.
